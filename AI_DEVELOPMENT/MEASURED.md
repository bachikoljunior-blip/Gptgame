# Measured

<!--
Written by `npm run measure`. Do not edit by hand: the digest at the end is checked,
and an edited file fails `node scripts/verify-continuity.mjs`.

This file is the authority for what was measured. AI_DEVELOPMENT/STATE.yaml is the
authority for judgement and plan. Where they disagree, this file is right.
